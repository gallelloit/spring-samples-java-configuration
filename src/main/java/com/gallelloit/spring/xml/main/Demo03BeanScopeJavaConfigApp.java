/**
 * Simple Spring application that creates a context from a Java configuration file (Demo03BeanScopeSpringAppConfig),
 * which explicitly configures the beans to be used.
 * 
 * It gets the bean footballCoach, which implements the interface Coach
 * This Coach implementation uses internally the implementation HappyFortuneService of interface FortuneService
 * as set up in the Java configuration file.
 * 
 * The resolved issue of this example is testing the two most used bean scopes from Spring: Singleton and Prototype
 * 
 * In the FootballCoach object, two alternative versions of the bean definition are specified through the
 * @Scope annotation in the Java configuration file. It must be specified with the scope strategy. The original proposed solution
 * has both alternative lines, one of which must be commented.
 * 
 * - On one side, Singleton (`@Scope(value="singleton")`), the default strategy, will make Spring to create and
 * return one instance of the bean no matter how many times the bean is retrieved. You can see in the example how
 * the memory location for the two retrieved objects is the same.
 * 
 * - Whereas when Prototype strategy is defined (`@Scope(value="prototype")`), any time a new bean is requested to the container, a different
 * instance is created and retrieved. This test can be performed commenting the singleton line and uncommenting
 * the prototype one.
